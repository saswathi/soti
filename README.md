# Console2
This project solution is for the problem statement:
Given two words of equal length that are in a dictionary, write a method to transform one word into another word by changing only one letter at a time. The new word you get in each step must be in the dictionary (assume English wordlist). 

EXAMPLE: 
Input: DAMP, LIKE
Output: DAMP -> LAMP -> LIMP -> LIME -> LIKE
